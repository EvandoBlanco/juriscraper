R.S. 13:5111 and/or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2501. The lower courts relied on the decision in Cooper v. Louisiana Department of Public Works, 03-1074 (La. App. 3 Cir. 3/3/04), 870 So. 2d 3151, to conclude the one-year prescriptive period for damage to immovable property found in La. C.C. art. 3493 governed and the continuing tort doctrine applied to prevent the running of prescription on the plaintiffs' claims. For the reasons that follow, we find the lower courts erred in relying on Cooper and now hold that the three-year prescriptive period for actions for compensation for property taken by the state set forth in La. R. S. 13:5111 governs and the plaintiffs' inverse condemnation claims are prescribed. REVERSED IN PART AFFIRMED IN PART.",

Accordingly, we reverse the ruling of the court of appeal and reinstate the district court's judgment. COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED, DISTRICT COURT JUDGMENT REINSTATED.",

    "summaries": "(Parish of East Baton Rouge) On June 27, 2007, a grand jury indicated defendant Dacarius Holliday (\"defendant\") for the first-degree murder of two-year-old Darian Coon. On March 14, 2010, a unanimous jury found defendant guilty as charged. On March 17, 2010, the jury unanimously determined that defendant be sentenced to death, finding the following aggravating circumstances proven beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) the offender was engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration of second-degree cruelty to juveniles and (2) the victim was under the age of twelve (12) years. See La. R.S. 14:30 (A)(1) and (5) and La. R.S. 14:93.2.3. This is defendant's direct appeal pursuant to La. Const. art. V, \u00a75(D). Defendant raises 52 assignments of error, variously combined into 29 arguments, all of which will be addressed herein. After a thorough review of the law and the evidence contained in the record before this Court, we find that none of the arguments set forth by defendant constitute reversible error. Accordingly, for reasons that follow, we affirm the defendant's first-degree murder conviction and sentence of death. AFFIRMED.",

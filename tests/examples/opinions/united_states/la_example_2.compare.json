    "summaries": "(Parish of Orleans Criminal) We granted the application to determine whether the warning that \"you have the right to an attorney, and if you can't afford one, one will be appointed to you\" - without further qualification - is a sufficient advisement of the right to counsel under Miranda. We note that the federal circuits are split on this question, and that the United States Supreme Court has thus far not weighed in. After reviewing the jurisprudence, we find a general advisement like that given in this case suffices, and that a statement need not be suppressed because of the failure to qualify the warning with an additional advisement that the right to counsel exists both before and during questioning. Accordingly, we reverse the rulings of the lower courts, deny defendant's motion to exclude his statements, and remand to the district court for further proceedings. REVERSED AND REMANDED.",

    "summaries": "(Parish of Orleans Criminal) Before trial, the defense was prohibited from introducing evidence of the victim's juvenile arrest for illegal carrying of a weapon. At trial, the defense unsuccessfully attempted to introduce other evidence of the victim's character. Specifically, the defense sought to introduce a photograph that depicted the victim holding a gun, evidence that the victim had threatened defendant on social media, and testimony of a witness that the victim had previously threatened defendant. In rejecting defendant's claim on appeal that the district court erred in excluding this evidence, the court of appeal found that defendant failed to introduce appreciable evidence of a hostile demonstration or overt act on the part of the victim at the time of the offense charged, as required by La.C.E. art. 404(A)(2)(a). See State v. Williams, 18-0445, pp. 19-20 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2/27/19), 265 So.3d 902, 917. Defendant contends that the court of appeal erred because testimony of an eyewitness (which is summarized below) constituted appreciable evidence of an overt act by the victim, and the district court overstepped its bounds in evaluating the credibility of this witness to find the evidence was not appreciable because the witness was not credible. We agree. However, for the reasons below, we find the evidence was otherwise inadmissible, and therefore we affirm the conviction and sentence. AFFIRMED.",

    "summaries": "(Parish of Jefferson) In this case, the State has charged D.T. with aggravated battery committed with a firearm and seeks to divest the juvenile court of jurisdiction and to prosecute D.T. as an adult pursuant to Louisiana Children's Code Article 305(B)(2)(j). In opposition, D.T. filed a motion with the juvenile court to declare La. Ch.C. art. 305(B)(2)(j) unconstitutional. The juvenile court granted D.T.'s motion. Pursuant to La. Const. art. V, \u00a7 5(D), the State sought direct review with this Court. Thus, the narrow issue before us is whether La. Ch.C. art. 305(B)(2)(j), providing for divesture of juvenile court jurisdiction when the child has been charged with aggravated battery committed with a firearm, is unconstitutional. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the juvenile court's ruling that the legislature exceeded its constitutional authority in creating an exception allowing divesture of juvenile court jurisdiction for a child charged with aggravated battery committed with a firearm, where that charge is not among the crimes enumerated in La. Const. art. V, \u00a7 19. AFFIRMED AND REMANDED.",

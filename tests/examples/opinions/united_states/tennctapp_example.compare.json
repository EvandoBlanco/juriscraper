    "summaries": "Sheila Dunlap (\"plaintiff\") brought this action alleging liability for the wrongful death of her daughter (\"deceased\") on the part of the nursing home operated by Laurel Manor Health Care, Inc. (\"defendant\") where deceased was living. Although the allegations of the complaint were couched in terms of ordinary negligence, the trial court determined that the cause of action was one for medical malpractice. The court dismissed the complaint for failure to comply with Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 29-26-122, which requires the filing a certificate of good faith with a medical malpractice complaint. We hold that the plaintiff's claims that the nursing home failed to properly administer medication and a medical device prescribed by a physician, and failed to monitor the medical condition of the deceased at all times prior to her death, sound in medical malpractice. Consequently, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.",

    "summaries": "This appeal involves the interpretation of an exclusionary clause in an automobile casualty insurance policy. The policy excluded coverage for a loss resulting from an accident occurring while the vehicle was being driven by an unlisted driver who \"is a regular or frequent operator of\" an insured vehicle. Caleb Jenkins, who was not listed in the policy as a \"driver,\" was involved in an accident while driving the vehicle of Kelly Weed (\"Insured\"). Insured brought suit after First Acceptance Insurance Company of Tennessee, Inc., (\"Insurer\") denied her claim. Insurer moved for summary judgment, alleging that Jenkins was a regular and frequent operator of Insured's vehicle. Based on Insured's statement that Jenkins was a \"fairly regular\" driver of her vehicle who had been driving it once or twice a week for six months, the trial court denied coverage and granted Insurer summary judgment. We affirm the trial court's judgment that the policy excluded coverage because Insured's admission establishes that Jenkins was a \"regular or frequent operator\" of her vehicle.",

After trial, the Trial Court entered judgment upon the jury's verdict finding and holding, inter alia, that Defendants had breached the implied warranty of habitability, and that Plaintiffs had sustained $50,000 in damages as a result of this breach. Defendants appeal to this Court raising an issue regarding whether the Trial Court erred in approving the verdict and denying their motion for new trial or for remittitur. Plaintiffs also raise an issue alleging that the evidence does not support the verdict. We find and hold that material evidence supports the jury's verdict, and further find no error in the Trial Court's denial of Defendants' motion for new trial or for remittitur, and the Trial Court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for new trial or for additur. We affirm.",

Mother subsequently filed a petition to set support, as well as a motion for relief from the final decree, both of which sought to have the court set support in accordance with the child support guidelines. The court denied the petition and the motion on the grounds that the parties had agreed in the parenting plan that child support would not be paid and that a significant variance did not exist. Finding that relief to Mother is appropriate under the circumstances, we reverse the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.",
